Mapify.io
=========

Mapify.io is a **Chrome Extension** project which improves **Kijiji** by adding Map Listing support, an automatic Load More feature (Infinite-Scroll), and various other improvements.

## Using Mapify Kijiji


### PageAction Icon

When the extension is enabled, these are the use cases:

1. ![MapifyKijiji - Valid Kijiji Listing Page](/src/images/icon38.png "Kijiji Mapify") (active) will appear on **Kijiji Listing Pages**
2. ![MapifyKijiji - Kijiji Page](/src/images/icon38_grey.png "Kijiji Mapify") (inactive) will appear on **All Kijiji Pages** 

---

1. Mapify's features are automatic. The infinity scroll by default is active and the map load will refresh on every new automatic load.
2. You are on another Kijiji page and the automatic features are disabled.




### Misc Notes

Initially [gmaps.js](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/) was used, but due to Google Maps and their API the map wouldn't display. After 3 hours of struggling to get GMaps to work in an extension and sequentially in a popup, I turned to [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and in < 10 minutes everything was working.

Craigslist recently (2012/10) implemented [map view](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/04/craigslist-rolls-out-new-map-view-feature-for-apartment-searches/). Craigslist also utilizes [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

## Details

This Chrome Extension was created during [#hackmtl](http://hackmtl.eventbrite.com/) on August 17, 2013 on top of the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Canada. It won the "Best Google Chrome Web Extension". 

I do plan on improving it's functionality over time, however it's currently not a priority.
