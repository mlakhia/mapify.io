Mapify
======

This project aims to overlay a map with useful information on sites such as **Kijiji** which have poor listing navigation implementations.

Craigslist recently (2012/10) implemented [map view](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/04/craigslist-rolls-out-new-map-view-feature-for-apartment-searches/). Craigslist also utilizes [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

If you have a suggestion or feature you would like to see implemented, visit http://mapify.io/suggest/ (coming soon - 2013/08/25) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/mlakhia/mapify.io/issues)


## Kijiji Mapify

This extension's icon ![Alt text](/chromext/images/icon38.png "Kijiji Mapify") will appear on **Kijiji listing pages**. When clicked a map will be presented with all listings on the current page.
