Mapify
======

Mapify.io is a **Chrome Extension** project that aims to overlay a map with useful information on sites such as **Kijiji** which have poor listing navigation implementations.

If you have a suggestion or feature you would like to see implemented, visit http://mapify.io/suggest/ (coming soon - 2013/08/25) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/mlakhia/mapify.io/issues).

Craigslist recently (2012/10) implemented [map view](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/04/craigslist-rolls-out-new-map-view-feature-for-apartment-searches/). Craigslist also utilizes [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).


## Kijiji Mapify

This extension's icon  ![Alt text](/chromext/images/icon38.png "Kijiji Mapify")  will appear on **Kijiji listing pages**. When clicked a map will be presented with all listings on the current page.


### Misc Notes

Initially [gmaps.js](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/) was used, but due to Google Maps and their API the map wouldn't display. After 3 hours of struggling to get GMaps to work in an extension and sequentially in a popup, I turned to [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and in < 10 minutes everything was working.

## Mentions

This Chrome Extension was created during [#hackmtl](http://hackmtl.eventbrite.com/) on August 17, 2013 on top of the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Canada. It won the "Best Google Chrome Web Extension". 

I do plan on improving it's functionality over time, however it's currently not a priority.
