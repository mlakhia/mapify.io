{"name":"Mapify.io","tagline":"Creates an overlay map using data points from existing websites. (currently only Kijiji)","body":"Mapify.io\r\n=========\r\n\r\nMapify.io is a **Chrome Extension** project that aims to overlay a map with useful information on sites such as **Kijiji** which have poor listing navigation implementations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using Kijiji Mapify\r\n\r\nThe icon  ![Kijiji Mapify - Mapify.io](https://raw.github.com/mlakhia/mapify.io/master/chromext/images/icon38.png \"Kijiji Mapify\")  will appear on **Kijiji listing pages**. When clicked, a map will be presented with all listings on the current page.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Misc Notes\r\n\r\nInitially [gmaps.js](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/) was used, but due to Google Maps and their API the map wouldn't display. After 3 hours of struggling to get GMaps to work in an extension and sequentially in a popup, I turned to [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and in < 10 minutes everything was working.\r\n\r\nCraigslist recently (2012/10) implemented [map view](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/04/craigslist-rolls-out-new-map-view-feature-for-apartment-searches/). Craigslist also utilizes [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Attributions:\r\n\r\n* The [PasswordBox Team](https://www.passwordbox.com/about)\r\n\r\n* Spin.JS - \thttp://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/\r\n\r\n* easyModal - \thttp://flaviusmatis.github.io/easyModal.js/\r\n\r\n* Leaflet JS - \thttps://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet http://leafletjs.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThis Chrome Extension was created during [#hackmtl](http://hackmtl.eventbrite.com/) on August 17, 2013 on top of the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Canada. It won the \"Best Google Chrome Web Extension\". \r\n\r\nI do plan on improving it's functionality over time, however it's currently not a priority.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, please do so and submit a pull request.
