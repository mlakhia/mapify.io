{"name":"Mapify.io","tagline":"Improves Kijiji with a Map, Ads/Listing Infinite-Scroll, and other various features.","body":"Mapify.io\r\n=========\r\n\r\nMapify.io is a **Chrome Extension** project which improves **Kijiji** by adding a Map, Ads/Listing Infinite-Scroll, and other various features.\r\n\r\n## Using Mapify Kijiji\r\n\r\n### PageAction Icon\r\n\r\nWhen the extension is enabled, these are the use cases where you will see the Mapify Kijiji icon appear in the omnibox (url bar):\r\n\r\n1. ![MapifyKijiji - Valid Kijiji Listing Page](https://raw.github.com/mlakhia/mapify.io/master/src/images/icon38.png \"Kijiji Mapify (active)\") (active) will appear on **Kijiji Listing Pages**\r\n2. ![MapifyKijiji - Kijiji Page](https://raw.github.com/mlakhia/mapify.io/master/src/images/icon38_grey.png \"Kijiji Mapify (inactive)\") (inactive) will appear on **All Kijiji Pages** \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Mapify's features are automatic. The infinity scroll by default is active and the map load will refresh on every new automatic load.\r\n2. You are on another Kijiji page and the automatic features are disabled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Misc Notes (2013-08-17)\r\n\r\nInitially [gmaps.js](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/) was used, but due to Google Maps and their API the map wouldn't display. After 3 hours of struggling to get GMaps to work in an extension and sequentially in a popup, I turned to [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and in < 10 minutes everything was working.\r\n\r\nCraigslist recently (2012/10) implemented [map view](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/04/craigslist-rolls-out-new-map-view-feature-for-apartment-searches/). Craigslist also utilizes [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Attributions:\r\n\r\n* The [PasswordBox Team](https://www.passwordbox.com/about)\r\n\r\n* Leaflet JS - \thttps://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet http://leafletjs.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n#### No Longer In Project\r\n\r\n* Spin.JS - \thttp://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/\r\n\r\n* easyModal - \thttp://flaviusmatis.github.io/easyModal.js/\r\n\r\n## Project Details\r\n\r\nThis Chrome Extension was created during [#hackmtl](http://hackmtl.eventbrite.com/) on August 17, 2013 on top of the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Canada.
